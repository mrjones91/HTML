	<h2> My name is Daniel Jones </h2>
	<p> Hello, I'm a senior here at TSU! My major is Interdisciplinary Studies
	with Computer Science and Art concentrations. I like to learn about and develop software.
	You can see <a href="http://www.wayofthejones.blogspot.com">my blog</a> to see some of work,
	primarily in game development. I'm also working with a group of friends on an app called
	<a href="http://www.qwst.co">Qwest<a> that is coming out on iOS on February 1st!<br/>
	I think this will not only be an exciting semester, but a great year!
	</p>
